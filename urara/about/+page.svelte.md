Hi all!

Thanks to spend some time on my personal blog post, I'm Vincent and
I hope you enjoy the time spent here.

I'm an open source software developer and right now I'm working on developing [Lightning Network protocol](https://github.com/lightning/bolts) full time, and I spent the rest of my time around the Rust language, more precise around the [async working group](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/welcome.html) and on the linux kernel with the focus on the [Rust-for-Linux](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux)

I'm interested in a lot of stuff and I try to keep all my interest updated, but more in general I'm interested in all that can improve my self, for this reason you can find me involved in many big open source project! I think it is the best way to learn.
